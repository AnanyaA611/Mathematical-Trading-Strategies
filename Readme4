Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Keltner Channel Strategy Combined with Hammer Candlestick Pattern for HDFC Bank Stock

Introduction:
This report presents a thorough analysis of the Keltner Channel strategy combined with the hammer candlestick pattern applied to HDFC Bank stock (equity = "HDFCBANK.NS"). The objective of this strategy is to identify potential buying and selling opportunities based on price movements and the Keltner Channel indicator. The analysis covers a period from July 6, 2013, to July 6, 2023, and includes calculations of Keltner Channels, visualization of price data and indicators, evaluation of performance metrics, and a detailed interpretation of the strategy's effectiveness.

Strategy Description:
The strategy combines the hammer candlestick pattern with the Keltner Channel to generate buy and sell signals. The hammer candlestick pattern is a single candlestick pattern indicating a potential price trend reversal, characterized by a small body near the top or bottom of a trend with a long lower wick. The Keltner Channel is a volatility-based technical indicator that helps identify price breakouts and overbought/oversold conditions. It consists of an exponential moving average (EMA) as the middle line, with upper and lower bands calculated by adding and subtracting a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) from the EMA.

Buy Signal:
To generate a buy signal using this strategy, we look for a hammer candlestick pattern near the lower band of the Keltner Channel. This suggests a potential oversold condition and a possible upward price reversal. Confirmation is sought by observing subsequent candlesticks. If the price breaks above the high of the hammer candlestick, it can be considered a buy signal, indicating a higher probability of an upward move in the price.

Sell Signal:
To generate a sell signal, we look for a hammer candlestick pattern near the upper band of the Keltner Channel. This suggests a potential overbought condition and a possible downward price reversal. Confirmation is sought by observing subsequent candlesticks. If the price breaks below the low of the hammer candlestick, it can be considered a sell signal, indicating a higher probability of a downward move in the price.

Visualization of Keltner Channels:
Two types of visualizations are used to gain insights into the Keltner Channel behavior. Yearly Keltner Channel figures are plotted for each year within the specified period, displaying the Keltner Channel, EMA, upper band, and lower band using matplotlib. Additionally, a combined plot of the Keltner Channel and the corresponding candlestick chart is generated for each year, showcasing the price data, Keltner Channel lines, and highlighting buy and sell signals based on the presence of hammer candlestick patterns.
